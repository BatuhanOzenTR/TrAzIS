Hello, I'm Batuhan Ã–zen. I was born in Istanbul, and I took my first step into this world on January 28, 2005. Currently, I am a senior student majoring in Web-Based Programming at a Vocational High School.

Working with computers and contributing to the world of technology is a passion of mine. Additionally, I have a strong interest in expanding my knowledge of the Korean language and deepening my connection to Korea, continually striving for self-improvement in this field.

For the academic year 2023-2024, I have seized the opportunity to work as an intern at Basbug Group. This experience will provide me with a solid foundation to kickstart my career and further my knowledge and expertise in my chosen field.

Honesty, collaboration, teamwork, respect, and sincerity are important values for me. These principles serve as my guiding compass, both in my personal and professional life.

Throughout my life, I aim to keep learning and growing. My goal is to make a mark in the world of technology and contribute positively to society. I am committed to continuing my efforts in this direction.
